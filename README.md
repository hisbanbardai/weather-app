# Weather App

### Project description
We are embarking on a weather app creation project that will empower users to access weather information for any city. The process will involve the user inputting the city name into an input field and clicking a button or pressing enter to retrieve the weather data. By leveraging JavaScript, we will connect to an open weather API to access relevant weather data for the specified city. To represent weather conditions, we will use icons or images like a sun or a cloud. In handling errors while fetching data from the weather API, we will employ the 'try and catch' technique.
